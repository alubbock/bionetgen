Running PhiBPlot
========================

PhiBPlot is useful for plotting the tabular output data that is produced by BioNetGen simulations on systems where Java is available. It allows a user to compare the results of two separate simulation data files at the same. Despite being quite old (10+ years), it continues to run on all major operating systems as of early 2018.

PhiBPlot can be run from the command line by typing

`java -jar "PhiBPlot.jar" `

To redistribute this project, simply zip up the PhiBPlot folder and unzip whereever you'd like to install. Note that the .jar files in the dist folder are required for PhiBPlot to run.

The source code for this project has been misplaced (it was last developed in 2006). If you are interested in further developing PhiBPlot, please post a message on this repository and we will try to find it and post.
